								Additionally, Bo showed remarkable empathy and sensitivity to the emotional toll that

								I am pleased to say that with Bo as my attorney, we achieved a favorable outcome in my

							<div class="text">Bo was my second lawyer. I ended up at his office after my prior attorney
								gave me bad advice at
								our temporary orders mediation and I had an uphill climb to come back from it. Bo will
								tell you straight, he really challenged my thinking and my ideas.
								I think I really grew as a person, from a stay at home mom with a very scared and
								controlled mindset. It has been great for my case and my self esteem.
								He is not cheap but I knew I wanted a litigator who would go to court (I'm also an
								attorney). Divorce is hard and petty. I was a mess and he was calm and planned
								long-term.
								I ended up with the custody and child support arrangement I wanted for the most part,
								without having to go to trial. Yes, Bo is expensive. He is worth it though.

								As an attorney I have been shocked at how poor many other attorneys out there are and/or
								the unethical tactics used. He works the case and does what is needed.
								He took me seriously which was so important to me. I knew I didn't want to totally
								destroy my ex as was suggested by several lawyers. Bo is a good mix of caring and tough,
								and I am very pleased with the great outcome he got for me coming from behind as I was.

								or options available. Since Mr. Nichols is a Family Court specialist, He is well versed

								case I was presenting had no chance. In my initial telephone conversation with Bo, I
								could see that he was asking a few questions that none of the other lawyers asked. He
								dug a little deeper and truly understood the dynamics of a very unjust settlement ruling
								that had been issued. Bo was able to correct the unbelievably poor efforts made by the
								previous attorneys by having the original sloppy divorce decree virtually re-written. He
								then presented a compelling case which clearly spelled out the neglect and unjust
								previous ruling. That resulted in the opposing party agreeing to a more just settlement.
								Bo accomplished what every other lawyer said could not be done. Throughout the entire
								litigation, Bo was extremely prompt in responding to phone calls, text or emails. Bo
								would respond, (not an assistant) many times within hours or on the same day. If you
								need a lawyer to do the impossible...Hire Bo!!!</div>

							<div class="text">Let me start by saying I rarely write reviews, and in submitting this
								review I’m also exposing myself to judgment for a few bad choices I’ve made. But I feel
								strongly enough about the representation I received from Bo Nichols to happily share my
								story. To my dismay, I am a repeat client of Bo Nichols. In 2010, Bo helped me with a
								very ugly, contentious child custody modification. I was not very well represented (by
								another attorney) during my first divorce and felt pressured to agree to terms which
								were not in the best interest of my children. With Bo's assistance, the situation was
								corrected and my kids and I got our lives back. Bo knew I was considering remarriage and
								despite his counsel to me in 2010, I failed to draft a pre-nuptial agreement before my
								second marriage. Hence, seven years later, in 2017, I found myself facing divorce #2 and
								I once again turned to Bo for assistance. Thank God there were no children from the
								marriage, but this time I was faced with fighting for everything I have worked so hard
								to provide for myself and my children. It was especially difficult for me because I am a
								woman with a successful career and 4 children to put through college. Bo helped me to
								put things in perspective, paint a vivid picture of my situation for the mediator, and
								ultimately resolve the matter to my advantage. Bo has tremendous knowledge of the law
								and the Texas court system. He fights for his clients with confidence, persistence, and
								edge. He is a no-nonsense type of attorney who is not afraid to go head to head with
								opposing counsel and take the fight to the court room, if necessary. However he also has
								a compassionate side. Bo was always there to help calm my fears and reassure me that
								everything would be ok. While I wouldn’t wish my situation on anyone, there is no
								attorney I’d rather have on my side than Bo Nichols.</div>
