					<p class="text text-center">Divorce is one of the most stressful things that a person must deal
						with. Divorce is like a death without the option of having a burial and a memorial service, and
						if you have children with your spouse, then you still have to find a way to co-parent and get
						along with that person for what could be years. It’s not easy, and at Bo Nichols Law, find the
						best divorce lawyers in Houston</p>
					<p class="text text-center">Most divorces are contested. This means that there are issues that will
						need to be worked out by a third party, which can be a judge, a mediator or an attorney. If your
						divorce is uncontested, both parties are in full agreement of the divorce and the division of
						property and it is simply a matter of filing paperwork and waiting the required amount of days
						before you can visit Bo Nichols and continue with proceedings.

						divorce lawyer. Interviewing attorneys to find the right fit for you is imperative because you
						will need to be able to trust your attorney, and you will also be spending a lot of time with
						them. They will be your confidante and your support system during this very trying and
						potentially long process.
					</p>
					<p class="text text-white">It’s important that your divorce lawyer in Houston, Texas knows the
						current Texas laws and Family Code and is admitted to practice in all Harris County Courthouses.
						Check into their background and be sure you are comfortable with your decision before hiring
						them.
					</p>
					<p class="text text-white">Your attorney will know to ask the right questions, file the right
						paperwork, and take the right depositions. The interrogatories will be asked for in a timely
						manner, and your attorney will not inundate the other attorney with unnecessary emails and phone
						calls that drive up your bill. They will be on your side always.
					</p>
					<p class="text text-white">Your attorney will be able to explain the Texas Family Code regarding
						Child Support and Visitation and Custody to you in a very clear manner so you understand it and
						won’t get frustrated with you when you have questions.</p>

						assets by filing discovery and temporary restraining orders or injunctions to prevent the
						transfer or “hiding” of assets and possible harassment.

						determine such things as who stays in the home during divorce proceedings, living arrangements
						for children involved, and who pays the bills during this time

						courtroom.</p>
