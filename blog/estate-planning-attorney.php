                                            should be distributed
                                            after your death. It’s
                                            straightforward but must go through probate, which can be time-consuming and
                                            public.

                                            A trust, on the other hand, allows your assets to bypass probate and be

                                            according to your instructions. Trusts are ideal for individuals seeking
                                            greater control over how
                                            and when beneficiaries receive assets.
