                                                division</a> is one of the most complex and contested
                                            components of divorce litigation. When a marriage dissolves, courts must
                                            determine how to classify, value, and distribute marital property in a
                                            manner that satisfies statutory requirements and aligns with principles of
                                            fairness. For many clients, this process dictates their long-term financial
                                            stability, tax implications, and post-divorce economic viability. At <a
