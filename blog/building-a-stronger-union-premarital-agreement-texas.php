                                            Discussing a premarital agreement encourages couples to have open, honest
                                            conversations
                                            about their goals, priorities, and expectations. This level of transparency
                                            often strengthens the
                                            relationship.

                                            It’s a sign that
                                            both partners value clear communication and want to protect each other’s
                                            interests—not take
                                            advantage of them.

                                            have adequate
                                            time to review, reflect, and consult independent legal counsel if desired.

                                            A rushed or last-minute prenup can sometimes be challenged later on grounds
                                            of coercion or
                                            unfairness. Planning early demonstrates that both parties entered the
                                            agreement willingly and
                                            with full understanding.
