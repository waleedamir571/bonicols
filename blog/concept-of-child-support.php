                                                <div class="text">Child support can be a confusing and complicated process for all parties involved. The laws that apply in one state may not match up with the standards of another, so it's always best to consult an experienced family law attorney near you who will
                                                help explain how things work overall as well as a guide through any details specific about your situation or location where custody agreements must take place.
                                                      <br><br>
                                                    There are some basic things that parents should know. First, a custodial parent has primary custody most of the time and defines non-custodial or
                                                    "other" parent as someone with physical supervision limited only by the law in their country; however, they may also have legal authority over your child's welfare.
                                                    <br><br>
                                                    The goal of child support is that the parents split financial responsibility for raising their children. This typically means non-custodial makes 
                                                    regular payments to help cover basic needs like food and clothing while custody remains with mom or dad!

        <h3>Uses for Child Supports</h3>

                                                <div class="text">Money paid as child support is supposed to be used to care for children involved. It's not up
                                                to a custodial parent; however, they may choose to use it themselves if need be - which can lead to conflicts and confusion
                                                about what exactly should happen with this payment.

                                                   Child support is designed to maintain the standard of living for children and ensure they have all their basic needs met. The money can be used in such things as:<br>
                                                      
                                                      
                                                      
                                                    <ul>
                                                        <li>When you're a parent, the most important thing is to ensure your child has everything they need for a healthy life.</li>
                                                        <li>Medical expenses are an important part of keeping your child healthy and happy. These include doctor's visits and medications who 
                                                        need it most but can't cover under parent plans because they're too expensive - that way, you don't have to worry about paying out-of-pocket costs if something happens!.</li>
                                                        <li>There are a few different ways to cover your child's healthcare needs. One option is for one parent or guardian to enroll them in their health insurance plan,
                                                        which will be effective until the age of 18 if they remain covered under this benefit.</li>
                                                        <li>The cost of extracurricular activities, including sports and summer camps, should be included in your child’s annual educator expenses.</li>
                                                    </ul>
                                                    <br><br>
                                                    When the custodial parent receives support, it should not be used for their expenses unrelated to children. Misuse of funds includes things like clothing or 
                                                      <br><br>
                                                      entertainment that do nothing about childrearing and vacations, which can potentially harm them if they are spending too much time enjoying themselves rather than taking care of what's important- the kids!
                                                      <br><br>
                                                      When a parent agrees to provide financial support for their child, they should agreement detail how this money will be spent. It may also have ways of dealing with unexpected expenses that
                                                      come up in the future and sharing those costs among both parties as needed or desired.

                                                <div class="text">When it comes to school, you need a lot for your child. You'll want supplies and books and clothing or other related costs like transportation- all of which can be expensive!
                                                     
                                                   <br><br>
                                                   When a parent pays child support, they are not providing enough money to cover the necessities of life like childcare and medical expenses. Accordingly, 
                                                   these additional costs must come from either person who owes spousal or partner's duties at home.
                                                    <br><br>
                                                    Extracurricular activities are often required to be covered by child support, and these may also come up in an agreement depending on existing after-school expenses. Still, misuse of funds essentially includes anything that doesn't 
                                                    contribute to the well-being and betterment of a child's future needs or costs- which should get saved up from monthly income leftover at the end month if possible before it's spent.
                                                    
                                                     <br><br>
                                                     The best way to avoid any misuse of funds is by having an agreement that defines how and when spending can occur. Both parents and they need to
                                                     be on board with their roles throughout the process- after all, it would be costly if one person felt shafted out because he didn't know what was going down!
