                                            financial uncertainty — not just for parents, but especially for children.
                                            While parents may part ways, their shared responsibility towards their child
                                            never ends. That’s where child support becomes more than a legal obligation
                                            — it becomes a lifeline that sustains a child’s sense of security,
                                            stability, and care.

                                            In most states, including Texas (where Bo Nichols Law is based), child

                                            For example, Texas law typically assigns a percentage of the paying parent’s
                                            net income toward support, with each additional child increasing that
                                            percentage. However, courts can adjust that amount depending on the family’s
                                            unique circumstances.
