They must ensure that the decision is in the child's best interest and both parents'. Texas law support that the child or children maintain a close relationship with both parents and be spared from an unnecessary fight between the parents. 
With said that, if the custody and visitation issues are not solved with mutual agreement, the judge will make a decision for these issues in a divorce proceeding. But what factors take part in deciding a child's custody?

                                                <div class="text">Some children have strong opinions to live with either parent, especially if they are older to understand family matters. 
                                                However, the court usually does not prefer to indulge the kids in chiming in these matters. 
                                                      <br>
                                                      Nevertheless, if a child asks to live with one parent, it is essential to find the reason behind this desire. Also, the decision-making power of the child is assessed to ensure someone does not force that child. <br>
                                                      According to Texas law, the court may listen to the preferences of kids older than 12 years of age, but it is still the court's responsibility to make a decision that fulfills the child's best interest.

                                              <div class="my-texttt">
                                                <div class="text">The parent or guardian who receives the primary custody of the child is called the managing conservator, while the co-parent with visitation rights is the possessory conservator. The schedule of the visit varies with each case and depends on the age of the child and the circumstances of the divorce case.
                                                The Texas court follows a standard custody order of the Texas Family Code, and the divorces in Houston follow the same visitation schedule.  
                                                      <br>
                                                      Usually, the visitation schedule includes two weekends per month, alternate holidays, and summer vacations for the children.<br>
                                                      
                                                      It is the responsibility of the managing conservator to make the child available to the possessory conservator on each visitation day. 
                                                      Weekend plans for the child cannot cancel the visit to the possessory conservator as the co-parent can use this evidence in the court to ask for custody modification.
                                                      Both parents should help their kids maintain a positive relationship with another parent.

                                                or both parents. This may result in your kid not being willing to meet the other parent; however, you must convince your child to spend time with your spouse.

                                                      Parents should try to keep their child apart from fights and damaging relationships, but if your child is older enough to understand these matters, eventually, you cannot do so.

                                                    Well, if your kids don't want to spend time with your ex, try to convince them. Otherwise, your co-parent can ask the court for custody enforcement. Your ex might present this matter against you and claim that you are engaged in turning the child against them. In addition, speak to your child about the issue or the reason for refusal to meet the other parent; in this way, 
                                                    you may find your way to convince the child or file a request to modify the custody order. You can get help from a professional child custody attorney to file a petition for modification of custody orders.

                                                affect your child's entire life. Needless to say, you must make decisions that are in your child's best interest.  
                                                      <br>
                                                      
                                                   Like all other states law, the Texas court also emphasizes building a positive relationship of the child with both parents and granting the child's custody to the parent who is more capable of taking care of the kid.
                                                   If you need any help regarding child custody and parenting rights, or you need to file a petition for child custody, contact us, and we are here to help you!
