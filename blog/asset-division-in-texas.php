                                            the financial uncertainty can feel even heavier. One of the biggest concerns
                                            people face during a divorce in Texas is asset division. Who gets the house?
                                            How are investments split? What about retirement accounts or a business you
                                            built from the ground up?

                                            Texas follows a community property system, which sounds simple on the
                                            surface, but the real-world process is often complex, fact-driven, and
                                            extremely personal. At <a href="https://bonicholslaw.com/">Bo Nichols

                                        Texas courts divide assets based on what is “just and right.” This means the
