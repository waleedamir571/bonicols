                                            over time. One of the most challenging parts of that process is dividing

                                            complex investments, the way assets are split can have lasting financial

                                                statements, and property documents.

                                                Don’t transfer, sell, or hide assets once divorce becomes likely; the
                                                court could view that as
                                                fraud or asset dissipation.
                                                <br>

                                                These methods can reduce conflict, lower legal costs, and give you more
                                                control over how
                                                assets are divided.

                                                Once the divorce decree is finalized, both parties must take steps to
                                                transfer titles, update
                                                beneficiaries, and close or divide accounts.
