                                            help cover the child's or children's living expenses. The custodial parent
                                            (the one who has primary physical custody) usually receives these payments.

                                    <div class="text">The goal of child support is to minimize the economic impact on a
                                        child when their parents no longer live together. This financial support helps
                                        maintain the child’s standard of living and ensures they receive proper care,
                                        housing, and education.
                                        <br>
                                        In addition to meeting legal obligations, paying child support promotes shared
                                        responsibility and involvement from both parents. It also helps reduce
                                        government assistance usage by ensuring private support is provided.

                                            In cases of joint or shared custody, child support is still typically
                                            ordered. The amount may be reduced since both parents spend a significant
                                            amount of time with the child, but each case is reviewed individually.

                                            <br>
                                            Some courts may calculate support based on how many overnights the child
                                            spends with each parent, along with income levels.

                                            If one parent lives in another country, collecting child support can be more
                                            complicated—but not impossible. The Hague Convention on the International
                                            Recovery of Child Support helps parents enforce support orders across
                                            borders

                                            Countries that are part of this treaty are obligated to assist in enforcing
                                            valid child support orders. Check whether the country in question is a
                                            member of this convention.
