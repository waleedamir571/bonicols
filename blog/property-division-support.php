                                            anything you and your spouse gain during the
                                            marriage is considered community property. But that doesn’t mean everything
                                            is automatically divided in half. Judges look at what’s fair for each

                                            If you’re preparing for divorce, taking early steps can protect your
                                            financial future:

                                            <br>
                                            Gather tax returns, bank statements, and investment documents.

                                            <br>
                                            Create a list of all assets and debts.

                                            <br>
                                            Avoid hiding or selling assets — it can backfire legally.
                                            <br>
                                            Document the value of major items.

                                            <br>
                                            Keep records of separate property (inheritances, gifts, premarital assets)
                                            <br>
                                            Stay off social media regarding finances.
                                            <br>
                                            The more prepared you are, the stronger your case will be.
