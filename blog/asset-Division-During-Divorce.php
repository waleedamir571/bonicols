                                            divorce is asset division. When a marriage ends, dividing property,
                                            investments, debts, and other assets fairly becomes critical. As a family
                                            law attorney, I often guide clients through the legal, financial, and
                                            personal challenges of separating their lives and belongings.

                                            How to Protect Yourself During Asset Division
                                            <br>
                                            As a divorce attorney, here are the top steps I recommend:
                                            <br>
                                            Gather documentation early – Include titles, tax returns, bank statements,
                                            investment records, and loan documents.
                                            <br>
                                            Keep track of separate property – Prove that an asset is yours alone with
                                            clear documentation (wills, deeds, account histories).
                                            <br>
                                            Get professional valuations – Especially for businesses, homes, and
                                            retirement plans.
                                            <br>
                                            Be transparent – Hiding assets can backfire legally and financially.
                                            <br>
                                            Hire an experienced divorce attorney – Legal guidance ensures your rights
                                            and future security are protected.
