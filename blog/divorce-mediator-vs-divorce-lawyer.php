Not only the decision to divorce is challenging, choosing a mediator vs. divorce lawyer makes it more difficult. 
Many individuals don't want to hire a lawyer to cut the expense of divorce – however, mediators also fail to reach an agreement in some divorce cases. This comparison doesn't mean that lawyers and mediators work in opposition. In fact, some divorce cases require a lawyer and a mediator too! 
A mediator is a neutral person who focuses on the best interest and mutual agreement between both parties; however, a divorce lawyer only emphasizes the clients' best interest. 
So, which is better – a divorce attorney or a mediator? 
Hold on! Before reaching the conclusion of choosing a divorce lawyer or a divorce mediator – it is important to learn about the differences between each and the outcome they can have on your divorce.

                                                <div class="text">It is the traditional type of divorce where couples walk to the court for a divorce. One party files a petition to terminate the marriage and decide about child custody and property division. Both parties hire their divorce attorney who will specifically represent and focus on the best interest of their client. 
Your divorce lawyer will represent you during each proceeding without concerning about the best interest of your spouse. A lawyer is beneficial 
in divorce cases if the other party has hired a lawyer, your spouse is dishonest about the
finances, you don’t trust your spouse, and you have spousal support, child custody, and child support disputes with your partner.

                                                In addition, if you have experienced domestic abuse, you might need a temporary protection order from the court. A lawyer can help you in this case, and your mediator cannot.
