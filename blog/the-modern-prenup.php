                                            about the value of a premarital agreement, also known as a prenuptial
                                            agreement or prenup. While often misunderstood, a properly drafted
                                            premarital agreement can protect both parties, clarify financial
                                            expectations, and avoid lengthy disputes in the event of a divorce.

                                            In this blog, I’ll explain what a premarital agreement is, who should
                                            consider one, what it can (and can’t) include, and why having one in place
                                            is often a smart legal decision in 2025.

                                            separation or divorce. It includes decisions about where the child lives,
                                            who makes important choices about their upbringing, and how much time each

                                            strongly encourage couples to at least
                                            have a conversation about a premarital agreement. It’s not about
                                            mistrust—it’s about mutual respect, transparency, and long-term security.
