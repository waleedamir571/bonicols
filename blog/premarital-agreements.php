                                        <div class="text">When two people begin planning a life together, the focus is
                                            often on joy, partnership, and
                                            dreams for the future. Yet for many couples—especially those with
                                            significant assets, prior
                                            marriages, children from previous relationships, or unique family or
                                            business interests—there is
                                            value in having clear financial expectations. That’s where a premarital
                                            agreement (sometimes
                                            called a prenuptial agreement) comes in.

                                            is a legal contract entered into by two
                                            people before they marry (or
                                            sometimes just before the marriage ceremony) that sets out how certain
                                            rights and obligations
                                            will work during the marriage, and importantly, if the marriage ends either
                                            by divorce or by
                                            death.

                                            For example, the agreement might specify how property owned before the
                                            marriage will be
                                            handled, how debts are shared, how income earned during the marriage is
                                            treated, or what
                                            support obligations may apply in the event of a dissolution. According to Bo
                                            Nichols Law, such
                                            agreements “protect both parties by setting clear expectations ahead of
                                            time.
                                            <br>
                                            In short, it’s not about expecting failure—it’s about clarity,
                                            communication, and <a

                                        Here are some of the major reasons couples consider a premarital agreement:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Clarity and certainty: By defining in advance how assets and debts will
                                                be handled, the
                                                couple reduces surprises and uncertainty. This can make a future divorce
                                                or estate settlement
                                                smoother, if it occurs.

                                            </li>
                                            <li>Protecting separate property: If one or both parties bring in
                                                significant assets (business
                                                interests, inheritances, real estate, etc.), a premarital agreement can
                                                help ensure those remain
                                                separate, or outline how they’re treated.

                                            </li>
                                            <li>Preserving family interests: If children from prior relationships are
                                                involved or one
                                                spouse wants to protect certain inherited assets, the agreement can help
                                                accomplish that.

                                            </li>
                                            <li>Reducing conflict later: Having clear terms ahead of time can reduce
                                                disagreement if
                                                things don’t go as planned.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>Encouraging open financial discussion: The process forces the couple to
                                                talk about their
                                                financial picture, expectations, and goals—something every marriage
                                                benefits from.

                                            </li>
