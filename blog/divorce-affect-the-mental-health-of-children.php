                                            Explain the psychological effects of divorce on children. Well, it depends.
                                            While most kids experience
                                            some level of stress after their parents' separation or dissolution, there's
                                            a whole
                                            range in how quickly they bounce back -- with some being able to pick
                                            themselves up quicker than others.

                                            What can you do if your child seems more prone to feeling sad/depressed over

                                            through a divorce and couldn't see how their
                                            family could survive. It's no wonder that kids experience distress;
                                            after all these major changes have taken place with one parent going ﻿to an
                                            apartment somewhere distant while another person watches over them at home

                                            This is a difficult topic for any child, but it can be especially so in the
                                            case of divorce. Some kids seem to bounce back and grow used their new
                                            living arrangements
                                            while others never really go "back" normal after their parents' separation
                                            or dissolution; this
                                            small percentage may experience ongoing problems like depression due to
                                            being uprooted from one home environment into another without ever feeling
                                            settled down enough before moving again.
