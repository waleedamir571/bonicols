                                                want to live together as friends with benefits but still be able to engage sexually at times without feeling committed beyond those boundaries, or would rather move past this stage altogether.

Nowadays, all states offer some form of "no-fault" divorce. In a no-fault arrangement, you don't need to prove that your spouse is at fault for the marriage failing; instead, simply stating irreconcilable differences or an irreversible breakdown in the relationship will suffice!
