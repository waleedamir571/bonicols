                                            rarely easy, but one of the most challenging
                                            aspects often involves dividing property
                                            and assets fairly. In Texas, the law follows a community property system,
                                            which means that
                                            almost everything acquired during a marriage is presumed to belong to both
                                            spouses equally.
                                            However, determining what’s truly “community property” and what remains
                                            separate can
                                            become complex without the right legal guidance.

                                        contributions to the family—when deciding what’s fair.
