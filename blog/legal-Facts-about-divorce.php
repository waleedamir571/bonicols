While it may be hard to share information about your finances with the person who will likely become estranged from them after a divorce, you should do so. In California, many laws require spouses' 
voluntary disclosure of all financial documents and updates as new facts come up for both sides involved agree upon what exactly they should provide before court proceedings 
begin or else risk having their settlement denied because either party didn't give accurate accountings during negotiations leading up until filing suit against one another (known legally here).
