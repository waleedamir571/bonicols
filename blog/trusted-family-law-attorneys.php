                                            However, when litigation is necessary, we are prepared to advocate

                                            protect your rights.

                                                assets</a> can be one of the most complicated aspects of
                                            a divorce. Texas is a community
                                            property state, which means most assets and debts acquired during marriage
                                            are considered
                                            jointly owned. Understanding your rights in property division is crucial to
                                            securing your
                                            financial future.
