                                            Houston residents, these laws play a major role in the outcome of a divorce.

                                        on fairness. Texas is different — it treats
                                        almost everything acquired during the marriage as community property, meaning it
                                        belongs to both spouses equally.

                                        However, this does not mean everything gets split in half. Texas courts divide
                                        property based on what is “just and right,” which opens the door for unequal
                                        splits when appropriate.

                                            People often make errors that impact their long-term stability. The most
                                            common include:
                                            <br>
                                            Posting on social media
                                            <br>
                                            Screenshots become evidence quickly.
                                            <br>
                                            Moving money or hiding assets
                                            <br>
                                            Texas courts take financial misconduct seriously.
                                            <br>
                                            Allowing arguments to escalate
                                            <br>
                                            Conflict can impact custody outcomes.
                                            <br>
                                            Giving up too much just to “get it over with.”

                                            it alone.
