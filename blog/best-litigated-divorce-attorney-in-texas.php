                                            significant relationship, which can evoke feelings of grief similar to those
                                            experienced after a death. However, unlike the finality of death, divorce
                                            often involves ongoing interactions with an ex-spouse, particularly if
                                            children are involved. This ongoing connection can make it challenging to
                                            move on emotionally.

                                            mediation tends to be more collaborative and less adversarial, divorce
                                            litigation can be significantly more stressful and emotionally draining.

                                            often a shared future. The grieving process can be intense, with feelings of
                                            sadness, loneliness, and emptiness. This grief is compounded by the
                                            practical changes that accompany divorce, such as moving to a new home,
                                            changes in financial status, and adjusting to single parenthood.

                                            Anger is a common emotion during divorce. You may feel angry at your spouse

                                            Resentment can also build if the <a href="https://bonicholslaw.com/blog/differenttypesofdivorces">divorce process</a>  is contentious, with

                                            anxiety. Questions about financial stability, living arrangements, and the
                                            impact on children can create a sense of fear and insecurity. The
                                            adversarial nature of litigation can exacerbate these feelings, as the
                                            outcome is often uncertain and out of your control.

                                            that it involves a formal legal process with attorneys, court hearings, and
                                            often, a judge's decision. This process can be lengthy, complex, and
                                            stressful.

                                            Litigation is inherently adversarial. Each party is represented by a divorce
                                            litigation attorney whose job is to advocate for their client's interests,
                                            which can lead to increased conflict and hostility. This adversarial setup
                                            can make communicating effectively with your ex-spouse difficult and can
                                            exacerbate negative emotions.

                                            In litigation, much of the decision-making power is in the hands of the
                                            attorneys and the judge. This can create a sense of helplessness and lack of
                                            control over your own life. Decisions about your future, finances, and
                                            children are made by someone who doesn’t know your situation as well as you

                                            This financial burden can be especially daunting if you already face a
