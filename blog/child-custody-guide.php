                                            “conservatorship.” While the word may sound complicated, it simply describes

                                        Joint Managing Conservatorship (JMC) is the most common arrangement.

                                        Sole Managing Conservatorship (SMC) is granted when one parent needs exclusive

                                        However, this does not mean everything gets split in half. Texas courts divide
                                        property based on what is “just and right,” which opens the door for unequal
                                        splits when appropriate.
