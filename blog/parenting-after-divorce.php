                                            divorce, determining how custody will be handled is one of the most
                                            important—and stressful—decisions they will face. The outcome impacts not
                                            only the parents but also the child’s emotional well-being, development, and

                                            who makes important choices about their upbringing, and how much time each

                                        If domestic violence is present in the relationship, courts may issue emergency
                                        orders or restrict custody to protect the child. Safety always takes priority,
                                        and supervised visitation may be required.

                                        As a lawyer, I’ve helped many clients secure protective orders and modify
                                        custody agreements to ensure a safe environment for the child.

                                        can be one of the most difficult parts of divorce, but with the
                                        right legal support and a child-focused mindset, it’s possible to reach an
                                        arrangement that works for everyone involved. Courts want to see parents
                                        cooperate and prioritize their children’s well-being.
