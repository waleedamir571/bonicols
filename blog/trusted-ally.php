                                            </b> While the firm is fully capable of litigation, its first instinct often
                                            is to find solutions: settlement, mediation, collaborative law. Only when
                                            necessary does it escalate. That balance saves clients stress, time, and
                                            often expense.

                                            </b>You’ll sit down (or virtually connect) to explain your situation. The

                                            is follow-up: enforcement if necessary, modifications if circumstances
