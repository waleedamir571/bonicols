                                        <div class="text">One of the biggest mistakes clients make is trying to
                                            “resolve” matters on their own. While the intention may be good, the
                                            consequences can be serious.
                                            <br>
                                            Why this hurts your case:
                                            <br>
                                            Anything you say can be used as evidence against you.
                                            <br>
                                            Emotional conversations often escalate conflict rather than resolve it.
                                            <br>
                                            You may unknowingly agree to terms that disadvantage you later.
                                            <br>
                                            Important discussions should be documented properly, not informally.

                                            The better approach:

                                            handle communication or advise you on what is safe to say.
                                            A strategic, calm, and legally sound message is always better than a heated
                                            personal exchange.

                                        Keep a dedicated digital folder. Save everything. Note dates, times, behaviors,
                                        and incidents. Your lawyer can determine what is useful and what is not.
