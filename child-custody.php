					<p class="text">Child Custody is always a hotbed when it comes to divorce. The two things that most
						couples will fight over are custody and money. When considering custody, here are some important
						facts to keep in mind.
					</p>
					<ul class="about-pt-2">
						<li>Custody should be based on what is in the child’s best interests, not the parents’ best
							interests. It is often difficult to distinguish between the two when you are in the midst of
							what can become an ugly divorce battle. This is why you hire a good child custody lawyer,
							who can keep a level head and guide you through the issues and help you determine what is in
							the best interest of the children.
						</li>
						<li>Texas law presumes that all parents will be granted the title of joint managing conservators
							and that both parents will be awarded periods of possession with the children. The rights of
							joint managing conservators still take place no matter which parent has possession, but
							there will be certain rights that the parent who has possession will get to maintain when
							they have the children and vice versa. Possession can take all shapes and forms, from the
							Standard Possession to a possession order that works best for the children or for both
							parents. The key is to try to work together to figure out what is in the best interest of
							the children.</li>
						<li>Texas law presumes that a standard visitation schedule will be followed in most cases for
							children age 3 and over. A judge can deviate from the standard schedule with good cause, and
							special allowances can be made for religious holidays. As we mentioned, parents can agree on
							custody arrangements that differ from the standard visitation schedule, and judges will
							almost always go along with their agreement. Regardless of the visitation schedule written
							into the divorce decree, divorced parents can always agree to follow any workable schedule
							of visitation they feel is best for their child. Possession orders are made by judges to
							provide a definite visitation schedule in case parents cannot agree.

					<h2>LEGAL FACTS</h2>
				</div>
				<div class="paragraph-container">
					<p class="text text-white"> It’s important to understand what “Standard Possession” is before
						entering into the agreement.
						The Texas Family Code provides a standard possession order for parents who live within 100 or
						over 100 miles of each other. For parents residing within 100 miles of each other, the standard
						possession basically divides holidays evenly between both parents and gives the parent with
						visitation at least two weekends a month, two hours on Thursdays during weeks not in possession,
						and 30 days during the summer.
						<br>
						<br>
						School holidays can extend a parent’s visitation. Under the standard possession order, if a
						parent has visitation on a weekend and the following Monday is a school holiday, then the period
						of visitation ends at 6:00 p.m. on Monday instead of Sunday. Likewise, if school is out on
						Friday, the weekend visitation starts at 6:00 p.m. Thursday instead of Friday.

					</p>
					<p class="text-high text-white">Differences for over 100 miles:</p>
					<p class="text text-white">Here are the differences for parents residing over 100 miles of each
						other:</p>
					<ul class="about-pt-2">
						<li class="text-white">Holidays are still the same, except spring break, which is given to the
							possessory parent every year.</li>
						<li class="text-white">The parent with visitation is given 42 days in the summer instead of the
							standard 30 days.
						</li>
						<li class="text-white">Elections to visit once a month instead of the 1st, 3rd, and 5th
							weekends.</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					<p class="text-high text-white">What does the Standard Possession Order include?</p>
					<p class="text text-white">The standard child custody order for parents who live less than 100 miles
						apart presumes that a child age 3 or older will live most of the time with one parent and that
						the other parent will have visitation on the following schedule:</p>
					<ul class="about-pt-2">
						<li class="text-white">Weekends starting at 6:00 p.m. on the first, third, and fifth Friday of
							each month and ending at 6:00 p.m. on the following Sunday (an option is to start when
							school is dismissed on Fridays and return Monday to school).
						</li>
						<li class="text-white">Thursdays during the school year starting at 6:00 p.m. and ending at 8:00
							p.m. (option: beginning when school ends and/or ending when school resumes the following
							Friday morning).</li>
						<li class="text-white">From 6:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. on the child’s birthday.Fathers have
							possession for Father’s Day from 6:00 p.m. on the Friday before Father’s Day until 6:00 p.m.
							on Father’s Day.Mothers have the same period for Mother’s Day.</li>
						<li class="text-white">In even-numbered years:Dad has the child during Spring Break, Mom has the
							child for Thanksgiving, Dad has the child for Christmas from the time school lets out until
							noon on December 26, and Mom has possession from December 26 until 6 p.m. on the day before
							school resumes. The use of “Mom” and “Dad” is for an example only—it could be reversed
							depending on who has primary custody. In odd-numbered years, the holiday schedule is
							reversed.</li>
						<li class="text-white">The parent with visitation has the child for 30 days during the summer.
							If that parent gives notice before May 1, he/she can designate the 30 days during the summer
							when he/she has possession in up to two separate periods of at least seven days. If no
							notice is given, he/she has possession from July 1 until July 31.</li>
						<li  class="text-white">
